This repo contains a lot of miscellaneous code files from my graduate research. 

`EllipseDiags` -> Contains basics from my SPVMD repo... working definition statements and publishable materials. 
`SaveCombineData` -> My convoluted ways of combining giant ERA-5 datasets, removing NaNs from ellipse diagnostics ... All for data management purposes. Very brute-force coding ... Ah, my favorite. :) 
`FromMasters` -> Self-explanatory? This folder combines a lot of pre-2022 code of mine and some publication-processed images from my manuscript that was rejected, RIP. (That's research!) Added bonus is the ERA-I climo plots of the ellipses at 10 and 50-hPa. 
`Prospectus` -> Arguably the most "hot mess" folder in here. All of my traditional stats testing on the ellipse diagnostics is here, evidence of many a failed multi-linear regression due to high multicollinearity. My attempts at k-means clustering are also in here. 
`EOFs` -> Paul Panhans and Andrea Lang's EOF code combined with some of my comparisons to stratospheric diagnostics. 
`S2SEllipses` -> Ironically, I found the S2S ellipse diagnostic calculation code while compiling this file. I was looking for it a while ago, and here it is.
